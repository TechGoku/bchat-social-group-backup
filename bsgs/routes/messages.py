def messages_since(room, seqno):
    f"""
    Retrieves message *updates* from a room.  This is the main message polling endpoint in BSGS.

    This endpoint retrieves new, edited, and deleted messages posted to this room since the given
    message sequence counter.  Returns `limit` messages at a time (100 if no limit is given).
    Returned messages include any new messages, updates to existing messages (i.e.  edits), and
    message deletions made to the room since the given update id.  Messages are returned in "update"
    order, that is, in the order in which the change was applied to the room, from oldest the
    newest.

    # URL Parameters

    - `seqno` — the integer `seqno` value of the most recent message retrieves from this room.  To
      retrieve from the beginning of the room's message history use a value of 0 (the first room
      post will always be >= 1).

    {_query_limit_doc}

    # Return value

    On success this returns a JSON array of message update objects.  Each element is an object as
    would be returned by [the single message retrieval endpoint](#get-roomroommessagemsg_id), except
    that updates for *deleted* messages are also included with the `"data"` key set to `null` and
    the `"signature"` key omitted.

    The endpoint always returns `limit` (or 100, if unspecified) message updates if they are
    available, so that a caller can determine whether it needs to issue additional room updates by
    seeing whether the returned value contains `limit` update: if this returns fewer than `limit`
    then there are currently no additional message updates.

    # Error status codes

    403 Forbidden — if the invoking user does not have read access to the room.

    Retrieves messages from the room preceding a given id.

    This endpoint is intended to be used with `.../recent` to allow a client to retrieve the most
    recent messages and then walk backwards through batches of ever-older messages. As with
    `.../recent`, messages are returned in order from most recent to least recent.

    As with `.../recent`, this endpoint does not include deleted messages and always returns the
    current version, for edited messages.

    - `msg_id` a numeric integer ID; the messages immediately *before* this ID are returned.

    On success this returns a 200 status code with a body consisting of a JSON array of the message

    Returns a single message by ID.

    # URL Parameters

    - `msg_id` the numeric integer ID of the message to retrieve.

    # Return value

    On success this returns a 200 status code with a JSON body containing an object with keys:

    - `id` — The numeric message id.
    - `session_id` — The bchat ID of the user who posted this message. Omitted in contexts where
      the information isn't available or isn't useful or available, such as in the confirmation of
      submitting a post.
    - `posted` — The unix timestamp (float) when the message was posted to the server.
    - `edited` — Unix timestamp of the last edit to this message.  This field is omitted if the
      messages has never been edited.
    - `seqno` — This message's event sequence number in the room; this number is set to the room's
      current monotonic sequence counter (*not* a timestamp!) when this message is first posted and
      whenever the message is edited or deleted.  Thus an update to this value for the same message
      indicates an update or deletion has occurred.

        Note that this sequence number is used for event tracking, *not* message ordering.  For
        example, an edit will increase this value so that polling clients will receive the edit, but
        the edit itself should change the content but not re-position the message.

    - `whisper` — If true then this message is a whisper, either directed at the retrieving user, or
      sent to all moderators (and the retrieving user is a moderator).
    - `whisper_mods` — If true then this message is a whisper visible to all moderators.  If false
      then this message is a whisper meant only for a specific user (and not all mods).  Omitted
      when the message is not either type of whisper.
    - `whisper_to` — The Bchat ID of the recipient of this whisper.  Omitted if the message is not
      a whisper, or if the whisper is for all mods without a specific recipient.
    - `data` — The actual message content, serialized as per Bchat.  For message bodies returned
      in a [`.../since` request](#get-roomroommessagessinceseqno) this field will be `null` if this
      message is an update for a deleted message.
    - `signature` — An Ed25519 signature of the data contained in `data`.  If `session_id` is a
      blinded ID (`15...`) then this is signed using the private key associated with the public
      Ed25519 key in the blinded bchat ID.  For unblinded IDs (`bd...`) the signature is
      verifiable using the XEd25519-specified converted pubkey of the Bchat ID.  If `data` is null
      this field (i.e. for a deletion update) this field is omitted.

    # Error status codes

    - 403 Forbidden — returned if the invoking user does not have read access to the room.

    - 404 Not Found — returned if the message does not exist or is not visible to this user.  For
      example, attempting to access a whisper meant for someone else, or attempting to access a
      deleted message will return this not found error code.

    Posts a new message to a room.

    # JSON parameters

    ## Required fields:

    - `data` — (required) the serialized message body, encoded in base64.
    - `signature` — (required) a 64-byte Ed25519 signature of the message body, signed by the
      current user's keys, encoded in base64 (i.e. 88 base64 chars).

    ## Optional fields:

    - `whisper_to` — Takes a Bchat ID; if present this indicates that this message is a whisper
      that should only be shown to the given user.  Note that only moderators may set this flag.

    - `whisper_mods` — Boolean.  If true, then this message will be visible to moderators but not
      ordinary users.  If this *and* `whisper_to` are used together then the message will be visible
      to the given user *and* any room moderators.  (This can be used, for instance, to issue a
      warning to a user that only the user and other mods can see).  Note that only moderators may
      set this flag.

    - `files` — Array of file IDs of new files uploaded as attachments of this post.  This is
      required to preserve uploads for the default expiry period (15 days, unless otherwise
      configured by the BSGS administrator).  Uploaded files that are not attached to a post will
      be deleted much sooner.

        If any of the given file ids are already associated with another message then the
        association is ignored (i.e. the files remain associated with the original message).

        When submitting a [message *edit*](#put-roomroommessagemsg_id) this field must contain the
